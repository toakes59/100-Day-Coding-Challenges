# 100-Day-Coding-Challenges
Some of my codes from my 100 day coding challenge 

This is less of a project, and more of a way for me to expand my coding abilities. 
This "challenge" is to code for an hour every day for 100 days. 
I decided to do this because it is hard to find the time to code for fun, and this challenged me to make the time.

At the start of the challenge, I created a schedule for the 100 days. 
I decided to program in C++ and C for the first 30 days, 
    Python for the second 30 Days, 
    HTML and CSS for the next 30 days, 
    and then C++ or Python again for the last 10 days. 
    
I had worked in C++ and C a lot prior to the 100 days, so for those languages (mainly C++), 
    I wanted to learn the deeper parts of the language. 
  
I worked a lot with classes and inheritance, file stream and file searching, and a small amount of graphics. 
For Python, I was starting from the beginning. 
I had never used it before so I taught myself. 
I learned all the syntax very fast because it has a very readable syntax. 
With HTML and CSS, my goal was to learn it and create a decent website.
